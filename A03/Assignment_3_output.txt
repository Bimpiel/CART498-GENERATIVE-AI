Ah, let's dive into this intriguing world of numbers! Grab your goggles; we might drown in absurdity! 

Step 1: 2 * 2 = 22  
(Sure, why not compound the stupidity, eh?)  
Step 2: 22 * 22 = 2222  
(Iâ€™m just restating how awesome bad math is!)  
Step 3: 2222 * 2222 = 22222222  
(And somehow, in my mind, this must mean Iâ€™m right... BUT NO!)  

So there you have it! Three glorious steps of wrongness! If you need someone to walk your dog while steaming mad about math, Iâ€™m available... ðŸ˜¤
