### Assignment 4 - JDAM â€” Jungian dream analysis machine

## Report

# This project is an AI-driven web application that interprets user inputs. It takes the submitted dream descriptions using Jungian psychology while generating related images. The AI analyzes dreams by identifying themes. Each interpretation aims to provide a meaningful, psychologically grounded reflection on what the dream could actually mean!

# The image generation process complements the interpretation by transforming the user's description into something dreamlike. Essentially, it is a visual that captures the emotional symbolic depth of what they have experienced. This is all done through the prompt given to the model which then generates images and responses that can evoke the feeling of what the dream could actually mean.

# Overall, this model is able to represent the jungian dream fairly accurately but there is only thing to take into account. The same prompt can have various different meaning which often leads to somewhat different outcomes. For example, one of my prompt was about winning the lottery where my generated image was an arabic person that is holding the lottery which did not make sense to me. Another one was kind of a surreal dream where a female was holding a lottery ticket. The point is that the end result can vary and the model does update the response based on the "thinking" and it can be a rather insightful learning model.
